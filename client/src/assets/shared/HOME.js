    info: 'Woofington Inn can be a great way to socialize dogs, especially if they are used to being the only dog in the household. During their stay, dogs have the opportunity to interact with other dogs under the supervision of trained professionals. The staff at the pet boarding place can help facilitate safe and positive interactions between dogs by observing their body language and behavior. They can also provide regular exercise and playtime in a controlled environment, which can help dogs develop their social skills and reduce their stress levels. Socialization at a pet boarding place can help dogs become more confident and comfortable around other dogs, which can improve their overall quality of life.',
